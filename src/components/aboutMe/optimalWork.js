    <h3>Optimal Employment:</h3>
    <p>
      As an extrovert transitioning into a new industry from an online bootcamp,
      I very much look forward to learning the programming sector's office
      environment and social standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimal employment for me (at this stage) would be with a temp agency that
      enables me to reflect on many short contracts, or being embraced by a
      longer-term employer with a diversity of tasks and/or horizontal job
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I love most about systems of any kind is the "ah-ha" moment when I
      can see and plan how everything connects. Perhaps I am naive, but right
      now I look forward to mastering the Jr. Developer position across the
      board more than I look forward to a Software Developer developer's role
      and paycheck.
    </p>
