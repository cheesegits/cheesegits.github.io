    <p>
      Playing national and international soccer growing up reinforced how
      rewarding teamwork can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      My <u>career ambition</u> is to find the right team, take pride in doing
      any task necessary towards group success, always build up coworkers and
      never put them down, and contribute everything I have until the deadline
      whistles blow.
    </p>
